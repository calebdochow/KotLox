KotLox is a Kotlin-based "Lox" interpreter based on the book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. 
KotLox covers chapters 1-11 of this textbook. This interpreter can handle variables, operators, expressions, statements, and user defined functions with closure.

In ~/src/tools/GenerateAST.kt, this creates both Expr.kt and Stmt.kt. These are the abstract syntax tree node classes.
